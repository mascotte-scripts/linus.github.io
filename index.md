## What is the Linus Framework?

Linus is a framework for the Grand Theft Auto V multiplayer modification, FiveM. Development of the project began during the summer of 2021 and we've worked endless amounts of hours into producing a high quality and performance optimized roleplay framework. Linus is designed to be extremely user friendly, removing the barriers that prevent even more immersive roleplaying experiences from happening, owned to difficulty in deciphering endless amounts of lines of code. In this regard, we pride ourselves in having created the first public framework that doesn't require any 3rd party applications - such as a MySQL database.
